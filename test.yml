      # This action downloads your repository's code onto the runner.
      # It's essential so that your 'date.py' file is available.

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment
      # This action sets up a specific Python version on the runner.

      # Step 3: Run your Python script
      # This step executes the 'date.py' script using the Python interpreter.
      # It assumes 'date.py' is located in the root directory of your repository.
